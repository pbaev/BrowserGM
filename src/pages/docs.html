<h1>Developer Docs</h1>
<p>BrowserGM is a project made with Vue.js.</p>
<p>This documentation contains descriptions of the website structure, classes, global variables, and global methods.</p>
<h1 data-breakpage>Structure</h1>
<h4>npm</h4>
<p>npm is used in development but not production, the following plugins are used:</p>
<p><u>babel</u> Used for the ability to write ES6.</p>
<p><u>browserify</u> Compiles all imports/exports into one file, bundle.js.</p>
<p><u>http-server</u> Runs a local server.</p>
<p>Below are the custom scripts run with &gt; npm run &#39;script&#39;:</p>
<p><u>compile</u> Compiles all JavaScript files into one bundle.js</p>
<p><u>server</u> Runs a server.</p>
<p><u>build-all</u> Compiles files then runs the server.</p>
<h4>Folder Structure</h4>
<pre><code>dist/
	bundle.js
node_modules/
src/
	classes/
	components/
	images/
	pages/
	scripts/
	styles/
.babelrc
package.json
packag-lock.json
</code></pre>
<p><u>dist/</u> Contains the bundle.js game file which is the compiled version of all JavaScript files in &#39;src/&#39;.</p>
<p><u>src/classes/</u> Contains separate files for each class.</p>
<p><u>src/components/</u> Contains files of components separated by category.</p>
<p><u>src/images/</u> Contains any website images, mainly player faces.</p>
<p><u>src/pages/</u> Contains all HTML files as well as .md versions of the documentation.</p>
<p><u>src/scripts/</u> Contains files of global methods separated by category.</p>
<p><u>src/styles/</u> Contains CSS files for the game and documentation</p>

<h4>age</h4>
<p>The player&#39;s age. All players age on the same day when seasons change on July 1st.</p>
<h4>attributes</h4>
<p>Attributes determine a player&#39;s effectiveness in game, each attribute is weighted by position for it&#39;s contribution to the player&#39;s effectiveness. The weighting is done by <strong>Player.categoryScores()</strong>.</p>
<h4>contract</h4>
<p>The player&#39;s current contract. If a player is not signed with a team their contract is {cap: 0, years: 0}.</p>
<h4>face</h4>
<p>The id of the player&#39;s face image. All faces can be found in &#39;images/players&#39;.</p>
<h4>fullName</h4>
<p>The player&#39;s full name. Derivatives like last or first name can be retrieved with <strong>Player.name()</strong>.</p>
<h4>id</h4>
<p>The player&#39;s randomly generated id. The id ranges from 10 9999999, they numbers no significance.</p>
<h4>league</h4>
<p>The player&#39;s current league. Can be one of: &#39;onehl&#39;, &#39;twohl&#39;, &#39;thrhl&#39;, &#39;juniors&#39;, &#39;prospects&#39;, &#39;freeAgents&#39;.</p>
<h4>newContract</h4>
<p>If a player has signed an extension in the last year of their contract,  then newContract is their extension. If no extension has been signed newContract is an empty object.</p>
<h4>position</h4>
<p>The player&#39;s position, can be one of: &#39;lw&#39;, &#39;c&#39;, &#39;rw&#39;, &#39;ld&#39;, &#39;rd&#39;, &#39;g&#39;.</p>
<h4>positionStrength</h4>
<p>Indicates a multiplier of player effectiveness when playing a position that isn&#39;t their main one.</p>
<h4>potential</h4>
<p>Ceiling is the maximum overall the player can attain. Chance is the probability of a player&#39;s ceiling being achievable, an actual ceiling is calculated based on chance in <strong>playerProgression()</strong>. Certainty is the user&#39;s certainty in a player&#39;s ceiling and potential when they are a prospect, this is based on scouting.</p>
<h4>progression</h4>
<p>Tracks the amount a player has progressed or regressed in each attribute since the start of the season.</p>
<h4>stats</h4>
<p>Each year of a player&#39;s stats is tracked up to 4 years.</p>
<h4>team</h4>
<p>The player&#39;s current team&#39;s id. If the player is a free agent the team is 0, if the player is a prospect the team is the team&#39;s region.</p>
<h4>Player.categoryScores()</h4>
<p>Returns a defensive and offensive player score to demonstrate the player&#39;s effectiveness in each category. Attributes are weighted on a scale of 1 or act as multipliers, a perfect score is 100 in a category.</p>
<p>Defence Score</p>

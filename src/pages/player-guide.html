<h1>Player Guide</h1>
<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>BrowserGM is composed of three leagues the 1HL, 2HL, and 3HL, your goal is to build a team that can win the 1HL which is the main league. 2HL and 3HL are your affiliate leagues which have one farm team per league in the 1HL, these can be thought of as equivalent to the AHL and ECHL.</p>
<h4>Roster Management</h4>
<p>There are no restrictions to which players can play in which leagues but rosters are limited to 23 players in the 1HL and 2HL. Scratches don&#39;t play games or progress their attributes so having exactly 20 players (18 skaters and 2 goalies) will guarantee that each player see game action. It&#39;s not possible to have less than 20 players as there would be empty line slots.</p>
<p>Players can stay in the juniors up to the age of 20, when they will either need to be signed to a contract or released. Junior players don&#39;t have stats but they do progress their attributes, albeit slower than if they were in a better league.</p>
<p>Contracts expire on July 1st, if a player only has one year left on their contract they need to be re-signed before that date. All players who are not re-signed end up in free agency, where any team can offer them a contract.</p>
<p>A contract&#39;s cap can range from 1 million to 15 million dollars, the length of a contract can range from 1-8 years. Up to the age of 21, all players receive a minimum contract of 1 million. Players under an overall of 76, no matter their age will ask for a minimum contract.</p>
<h4>Schedule and Playoffs</h4>
<p>All leagues operate under an 82 game schedule, games are played on average every two days. The top 16 teams league wide enter the playoffs with teams matched up between highest and lowest in points. Playoff series are in a best of 7 format.</p>
<h4>Scouting</h4>
<p>Every year a new set of prospects arrive ready to be selected in the entry draft on June 27th. Each prospect region has the same probability of having good prospects, but region strength will still vary year to year. Prospect potentials shown on their profile pages aren&#39;t the true potentials used by the game. The shown potentials accuracy positively correlate  with how much the prospect&#39;s region has been scouted.</p>
